# Self tentioning board mounted motor adapter
while researching how best to attach a belt drive motor to a long board I found that everyone attached thiers to the trucks of the board.
This has is hard to do well becuase the trucks are a very organic shape and made of cast alluminum so its not easy to make a bolt on solution.
Its nessersry to this because the trucks will move relative to the board while turning, beucase if the motor was fixed to the board the belt
tension and orientaion would change and the belt would likly snap or fall off. My solution to this was to use a spring and rail to passively tension
the motor but after making the CAD I too went for the truck mounting method.
